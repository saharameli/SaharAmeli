## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Education
Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Eastern Mediterranean University (GPA: 3.75/4)
During my academic journey, I gained valuable experience working on various projects that applied data analytics and machine learning to solve real-world problems. One of my notable projects involved predicting customer behavior using logistic regression.[ ](https://github.com/saharameli/CustomerPurchasePrediction.git)By leveraging Python, Scikit-Learn, and Pandas, I analyzed customer data to identify key behavioral patterns, providing actionable insights for business decisions.

Additionally, I developed a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. This project utilized Python, NumPy, and Pandas to analyze user ratings and preferences, creating personalized movie suggestions. I also employed Pearson correlation to improve recommendation accuracy and demonstrated the results through an intuitive interface.https://github.com/saharameli/MovieRecommendation.git

My expertise includes a range of data analysis and machine learning techniques, such as clustering, classification, regression, and data visualization, supported by tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and TensorFlow. Through these projects, I have honed my skills in extracting insights from structured and unstructured data and delivering practical, data-driven solutions.
